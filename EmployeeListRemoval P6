//https://repl.it/@Kunl19/EmployeeListRemoval#main.cpp

The program allows user to view a list of 5 employees. They are then prompted to remove one employees name by entering it on the command line.I was able to 
push the employee names into a vector to store the values. Once stored I looped over the vector to dispay the names to user. I then used the find and remove 
method to find the specific name the user entered and remove it from the vector. The new list of 4 names is then displayed by looping over the vector again.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    //display employee names
    vector<string> list;

    list.push_back("Kunle");
    list.push_back("Sam");
    list.push_back("Fred");
    list.push_back("John");
    list.push_back("Deji");
    //Pushes employees names into vector array

    cout << "There a five employees \n";

    for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
        cout << list[i] << "\n";
    }

    //Loops through vector printing out the names

    string name;

    cout << "Remove an employee : Enter a name from the list \n";

    cin >> name;

    if (std::find(list.begin(), list.end(), name) != list.end()) {
        remove(list.begin(), list.end(), name);

        //find name if in the list and removes it if = name

        cout << "Display new list of 4 employees \n";

        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
            cout << list[i] << "\n";
        }

        //Loops through new list

    }
    else {
        cout << "Name does not exists";
    }

    //If name is not in the list outputs else statement 
}
