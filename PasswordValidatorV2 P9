Primer 9

The program below validates the username and password a user enters with the a username and password in an external data stream. Using fstream we load the txt file. The user 
can then enter their username. In a while loop we use the strcmp function to check whether the username is equal to the saved username in the text file. 
The same is done for the password. If both values are match the saved value in the new.txt file the login is successful. If not the program fails to authenticate.

using namespace std;

int main() {
  //Saved username and password
  char password[20];
  char savedpassword[20];   
  char username[20];
  char savedusername[20];

fstream pull("new.txt",ios::in);
if (!pull) { 
    cout<<"File not loaded!"<<endl;
    return -1; 
}

cout<<"Username: ";
cin>>username;

while(strcmp(username,savedusername)){ 

//strcmp checks if savedusername and username are equal

    pull>>savedusername;
    if(pull.eof()){   //if it is the end of file
        cout<<"Failed to Authenticate"<<endl;
        return -1;  
    }
    //reset program and enter correct username (username)
}
//if username doesnt exist doesnt authenitcate

pull>>savedpassword; 

cout<<"Password: ";   
//user enters password
cin>>password;
//Password matches saved password
//
while(strcmp(savedpassword,password)){
    cout<<"Wrong password. "<<endl;
    cout<<"Failed to authenticate - Try again: ";
    cin>>password;
    //(the password is password)
}
cout<<"Login successful."<<endl;
return 0;
}
