Primer 7

This program displays data from a external data stream onto a console. In this case a csv file called file.csv is read using ifstream. A while loop is used to read each line
and save the information in a variable called info. It also saves indvidual data after every comma allowing us to format the data. An issue i had occured when trying to
format data into coloums. When longer last names were found in the table to salary data would be shifted to the right when the information was ouputted in the console.

      MyReadFile.close();
      //Close file
